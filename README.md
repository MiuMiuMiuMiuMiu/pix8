# Pix8 
Pix8 is a simple drawing program where the canvas consists of pixels in a 8x8 grid.

# Features
Pix8 consists of a colorpicker, brush and eraser. Each tool have a shortcut (c, b and e).

# Creation
Pix8 was created with Python and Tkinter (the standard GUI library for Python).

I first learnt of Tkinter when going through exercises in the book "Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs. 
After (mostly) finishing the book I felt like I wanted to create something to practice my skills. 
As I like knitting, I thought I could create a drawing grid for the purpose of knitting where a 10x10cm square in knitting could equate to the grids on the screen.
Then I realised it would be too technical for me to recreate and opted for something basic.
Maybe one day I will expand more on this project?

# All feedback is welcome
I'm a beginner afterall...
