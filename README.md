# Pix8 
Pix8 is a simple drawing program where the canvas consists of pixels in a 8x8 grid.

# Features
Pix8 consists of a colorpicker, brush and eraser. Each tool have a shortcut (c, b and e).

# Creation
Pix8 was created with Python and Tkinter (the standard GUI library for Python).

I first learnt of Tkinter when going through exercises in the book "Python for Kids" by Jason R. Briggs. 
After (mostly) finishing the book I felt like I wanted to create something to practice my skills. 
As I like knitting, I thought I could create a drawing grid for the purpose of knitting.
